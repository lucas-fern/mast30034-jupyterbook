# Tutorial 6: Project 2, Sprint 1

From this week tutorial attendance is marked. For the rest of the semester the tutorial slot will serve as a time to meet with your group and make progress on the industry project. 

Your tutor will act as a non-technical supervisor throughout the second project, making sure you're on track and assessing checkpoints, but won't be providing significant technical assistance.

## Tutorial Outline

In today's tutorial you should:
- Meet with your team
- Plan your approach to the first sprint of Project 2
- Set up your GitHub Classroom repository
- Set up a system for assigning and managing tasks (we suggest Kanban)
- Establish a communication channel for outside of the tutorial
- *(Suggested)* Plan an additional meeting slot outside of the tutorial
- Ask any questions you've got about the first sprint

## Sprint 1 Checkpoints

These checkpoints will be assessed during the tutorial *next week.*

```{tab-item} Buy Now, Pay Later
To receive the checkpoint mark for sprint 1 you must:
