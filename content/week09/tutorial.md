# Tutorial 9: Project 2, Sprints 4-5

## Tutorial Outline

In today's tutorial you should:
- Meet with your team
- Get your sprint 3 checkpoints assessed
- Conduct a retrospective on your sprint 3 performance
- Make plans for the 4th and 5th sprints
- *Plan how you will answer the key questions for your project*
- Ask any questions you've got

## Presentations

Over the coming weeks (including the mid-semester break) you should start thinking about bringing your presentation together.

Presentations are delivered in the week 11 and 12 tutorials, **but slides must be submitted by the end of week 10.**

Presentations are worth 30% of your mark for the subject, so worth getting started on this now!

## Sprint 4 and 5 Checkpoints

These checkpoints will be assessed during the tutorial *in week 10* (after the break).

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Buy Now, Pay Later
To receive the checkpoint mark for sprint 4 you must:
- Determine or create features or heuristics to rank the desirability of merchants
- Apply this feature/heuristic to produce a preliminary ranking

To receive the checkpoint mark for sprint 5 you must:
- Identify between 3-5 market segments and assign your merchants to these segments
- Refine your heuristic for ranking merchants
- Use your heuristic to produce a ranking of the top 10 merchants within each of your segments

Be prepared to show these things in the week 10 tutorial.
```

```{tab-item} Real Estate
To receive the checkpoint mark for sprint 4 you must:
- Begin forecasting the prices of rental properties in each suburb for the next 3 years (2024-2026)
- Find the most important features that make properties *in a suburb* more expensive *and* sought after

To receive the checkpoint mark for sprint 5 you must:
- Prepare a 3-5 minute summary notebook summarising your current findings on the project.
    - The notebook should summarise your current progress
    - And should outline your approach to outlining the 3 big questions

Be prepared to show these things in the week 10 tutorial.
