## Tutorials

Weeks 1-3 we will cover technical content relevant to Data Science jobs in industry.
- Tutorial content for these weeks is hosted [here](https://github.com/VoLKyyyOG/MAST30034_Python/tree/main/tutorials)
  - If you haven't already, `clone` the repo. We will be going through the notebooks and you should be able to run them.

Week 4 we will reserve some time to discuss the ongoing **Project 1**.

Week 5 we will be preparing for **Project 2** and we'll have an opportunity to cover miscellaneous data science/technical/industry content and questions that you are interested in.

**In weeks 6-12, workshops are compulsory.** We will be working on the industry project in our groups.
- Your tutor will act as a non-technical supervisor throughout this project.
- You will be required to complete the project autonomously, and guidance from staff will be limited (reflecting their non-technical supervisory role).
- The tutorials can be used to meet with your team and work on the project together.
- Weekly checkpoints will be assessed in the tutorials.
- Meeting minutes will be due at the end of each week.
