# Tutorial 1: Introduction, Project 1, and PySpark

Week 1 is a big tutorial. Here's what we're covering:
1. Intro and overview of the subject.
2. Git and Jupyter.
3. The Prerequisite notebook.
4. Intro to PySpark.

## Git, Jupyter, and the Prerequisite Notebook

The tutorial content is hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/VoLKyyyOG/MAST30034_Python/tree/main/tutorials). To get started:
- open the [prerequisite notebook](https://github.com/VoLKyyyOG/MAST30034_Python/blob/main/tutorials/tute_1/Python_PreReq_Notebook.ipynb)
  - if you've already done this, thanks!
  - if not, make sure you're reading our Canvas announcements
- `clone` the repository
  - you can use the [`git` Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- run the prerequisite notebook as a Jupyter notebook
  - you can choose to run Jupyter:
    - with Anaconda
    - in Visual Studio Code
    - with JupyterLab (`pip install jupyterlab` and `jupyter-lab`)
    - with Jupyter Notebook (`pip install notebook` and `jupyter notebook`)

This was a prerequisite, so do this while we discuss **Project 1** if you haven't already.

## Digression: Project 1

Project 1 is released. It is due on the first day of week 5. 

```{important}
**If you haven't started already, *start today*.**
- I'm serious!!
- No one listens to this, and everyone complains that we didn't give you long enough in week 5.
- This used to be due at the start of week 4, so we have little sympathy for people who didn't listen to this warning.
- The handbook says this will take **30 hours**. *This isn't a joke.* 
```

View the [assignment specification](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6487b326d555f7d3313a4de2) and complete the **Project 1 Canvas module** *today!*

## Intro to PySpark

Hopefully we've got about an hour left to spend on the [tutorial 1 notebook](https://github.com/VoLKyyyOG/MAST30034_Python/blob/main/tutorials/tute_1/Tute1_Python.ipynb).

Open this up in your Jupyter instance and we'll start talking through the content.

If you're struggling to run the notebook, ask the people on your table for help, then ask me.
