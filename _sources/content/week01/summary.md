## Overview
In this tutorial we will:
1. **Form groups of 4 that will last throughout the entire semester**,
   - Tutorial marks will be allocated for the group as a whole
2. Introduce ourselves to our groups,
3. Discuss our motivations for taking Ethics of AI,
4. Look at the structure of the subject throughout the semester.

## ChatGPT and Academic Integrity
```{dropdown} Won't people use ChatGPT to write their essays?
Yes.
```

```{dropdown} How can we be assessed fairly if people are using language models to write?
The essay prompts will be designed around your human skills:
- academic referencing
    - a minimum of 5 references in the first essay
    - a minimum of 10 in the second
- understanding of the specific content covered in lectures
- deep critical thinking
```

````{dropdown} So am I *allowed* to use it?
Yes. But we know what it's capable of. Feeding the essay prompts into a language model and submitting the response will *not* be enough to pass.

```{warning}
Content produced by language models is **NOT** your own work. It **must** be referenced as such to comply with [academic integrity](https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/plagiarism-and-collusion/artificial-intelligence-tools-and-technologies).

> *Knowingly having a third party, including artificial intelligence technologies, write or produce any work (paid or unpaid) that a student submits as their own work for assessment is deliberate cheating and is academic misconduct.*
```
````

```{dropdown} Will this inflate marks?
Maybe? We expect that most students who use these tools won't synthesize the *content* of their assessments, but will use them to edit and improve the quality of their writing.

This is welcome, and should result in better quality essays overall.
```

```{dropdown} Whats the official university policy?
The [university's policy on "Artificial Intelligence Tools and Technologies"](https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/plagiarism-and-collusion/artificial-intelligence-tools-and-technologies) states:
> If a student uses artificial intelligence software such as ChatGPT or QuillBot to generate material for assessment that they represent as their own ideas, research and/or analysis, they are **NOT** submitting their own work. Knowingly having a third party, including artificial intelligence technologies, write or produce any work (paid or unpaid) that a student submits as their own work for assessment is deliberate cheating and is academic misconduct.
>
> *If a student uses AI generated material in the preparation of their assessment submission, this must be appropriately acknowledged and cited in accordance with the [Assessment and Results Policy](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1326).*
